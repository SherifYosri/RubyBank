# Simple Banking Account

# Installation
I created a docker compose file so that the app can be up and running by executing just one command:
* Navigate to app directory and run "docker-compose up"

# Test files
To run spec files that are written using Rspec library, navigate to app directory and run
* bundle exec rspec spec

# Supported Currencies
Only "USD" currency is currently supported, but it's applicable to extend the functionality and support multiple currencies using a gem like "money-rails" in the future.
